## About Me

Hello! I’m **Ed Frost**, an experienced Endpoint Management Consultant with a passion for automation, scripting, and solving IT challenges using PowerShell. With over a decade in IT and a strong background in Microsoft Intune and endpoint management, I’ve dedicated my career to finding efficient, scalable solutions for managing and securing devices in enterprise environments.

### My Journey to Endpoint Management

I started my career in IT with a focus on systems administration, where I quickly found that PowerShell was a game-changer. It offered a way to automate tedious tasks and solve complex problems creatively, something that resonated with me from the start. Over time, I specialized in endpoint management, developing expertise in Microsoft Intune and other critical tools that help organizations manage their digital workforce.

Today, I work as a Senior Endpoint Management Consultant, helping clients deploy, secure, and manage their devices with tools like **Microsoft Endpoint Manager** and **Intune**. My role has me diving into everything from configuration management to developing custom PowerShell scripts that save hours and improve productivity.

### Why I Started This Blog

The world of IT is always changing, and it’s easy to get overwhelmed by new tools, processes, and best practices. I created this blog to help fellow IT professionals, especially those focusing on endpoint management and automation. My goal is to share practical, real-world knowledge that I’ve gained over years in the field.

Here’s what you can expect to find here:

- **PowerShell Tips & Tricks**: From the basics to advanced techniques, I’ll show you how to use PowerShell to streamline your tasks and save time.
- **Intune Management Tutorials**: Intune has become a cornerstone of endpoint management, and I’ll cover everything from setting it up to troubleshooting and best practices.
- **Automation & Scripting**: Whether it’s automating routine processes or tackling complex deployments, I’ll guide you through solutions that improve efficiency and reduce errors.

### My Goals for This Blog

Beyond sharing knowledge, I see this blog as an evolving portfolio that reflects my skills, growth, and contributions to the IT community. I’m not here to monetize or sell services. Instead, I want this to be a resource that IT pros can use, refer to, and maybe even contribute to over time. I also plan to incorporate video tutorials for certain topics in the future, adding a hands-on perspective to the content.

Thank you for stopping by! If you have questions, feedback, or just want to connect, please feel free to reach out on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pefrost) or join the conversation in the PowerShell and Intune forums. Let’s keep learning and growing together!
